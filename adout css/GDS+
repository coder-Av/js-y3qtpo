    <h3> about "GDS"</h3>
    <p1>  New Product Development (NPD) is the total process that takes a service or a product from conception to market. New or rebranded products and services are meant to fill a consumer demand or an opportunity in the marketplace. The steps in product development include drafting the concept, creating the design, developing the product or service, and defining the marketing.

A new product opens a whole new market: It can completely replace a current product, take over an existing product, or simply broaden the market for something that already exists. Sometimes existing products are introduced to new markets, repackaged, or marketed differently. New products can improve the use of a company’s resources, launch a company into a new market or segment of the market, improve the relationship a company has with its distributors, or increase or defend a company’s market share.

New products generally differ from a product line extension, which are products that are slightly different to the company’s existing array of offerings. Examples of new goods include mass-market microwaves and Keurig one-cup gourmet coffee machines. In the case of microwaves, a whole new market was born when they were mass-produced and offered at reasonable household prices. In the case of the Keurig machine, the gourmet coffee experience previously only found in a coffee shop was brought into the home. Examples of product line extensions include the Infiniti automobile line and Diet Coke. For the Infiniti line, Nissan targeted the premium vehicle market by extending their auto line at a higher price point. Coca-Cola company used Diet Coke to target the market of soda drinkers that wanted a lower calorie soda than their regular Coke product. Both of these products capitalized on pre-existing products that had already garnered brand loyalty. 

What Is Fuzzy Front End, and Why Is It So Important in Product Development Processes?
Process management is a technique that ensures improvements are introduced with a consistent, structured set of activities. In your product development processes, whether for a new or revamped product, your process management strategies are critical to ensuring that your products will be continuously improved. These strategies will necessarily include your product development processes, and ensure that even very complex products make it to market consistently and improved regularly. The four phases of product development are:

1. Fuzzy Front-End (FFE): FFE, often called the ideation step, is considered one of the best opportunities for driving innovation in a company. FFE is not frequently mapped in any formal way, since this is the phase where you pitch all of your great ideas for solutions to your customer’s problems. FFE is called fuzzy because it occurs before any formal development starts, in the vague period where little structure or defined direction exists. Very few products that are originally pitched in FFE come out of it; however, this stage of pre-development is critical. Successful completion of pre-development can take you seamlessly into development.

There have been many case studies that examine how FFE is done in different companies, looking for consistencies and best practices. Some companies have idea management software or some type of regular way that they generate ideas. Some companies use integrated product teams (IPTs), a group that is responsible for defining the product. Volumes have been written about FFE because of its relative importance in product development, but the FFE process is unique to each company.  However, there are a few consistent activities that occur with every FFE approach, and provide teams with critical decision points before moving forward. These include:

Determining the innovation goal. This preliminary analysis is your opportunity to figure out what problem you need to solve for your customers before you make a product. For example, one big failure in the annals of product history is Google Glass. Google made a device without considering what problems they were solving for their customers. Therefore, their product was a monumental (and very expensive) failure.
Figuring out what your customers think about this goal. People will buy a product or service that solves a problem for them, but the problem itself must be present. Products that customers don’t need, didn’t ask for, or degrade your brand loyalty are unsuccessful. For example, in 1985 Coca-Cola Company released New Coke, a revamp of their classic Coca-Cola beverage formula. This reformulation changed a 100-year old recipe based upon market taste research. However, once New Coke was launched, consumer outcry was overwhelming. Within 79 days, the company replaced New Coke with the original Coca-Cola formula repackaged as “Classic Coca-Cola.” New Coke is now widely considered the biggest commercial marketing blunder of all time.
Reviewing other market segments for possible connections or technology to get ideas. When thinking about new products, it’s important to collect data on how people are using the product, how much they will pay, and whether the price for the benefit is reasonable. During your market research phase, you should also review the market size and conduct a segmentation analysis.</p1>
