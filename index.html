  <p1> Welcome
Coding for non-techies
Stackoverflow is overwhelming.
Github is a mystery.
WordPress promises to be easy - but doesn't implement the way I want it to.
How do I become an independent coder?
This is for you.

Hello, World!
I've been coding with CodeAcademy for a while now, but when I tried to take what I had been learning in the platform and practice it on my own, I found myself in an endless loop.

I've learned SQL. How can I now analyze COVID-19 data?
Github is for version control but what is that? How do I use it?
Why does WordPress look so pretty, cost so much and also be so hard to use?
How do I create a blog from scratch?
Who knew there were so many opinions on how to format a logo for your website?
Why won't my logo change size?
Why aren't my css changes showing on my site?
What direction do I want all this to go?
How can I show my work if I hate doing web design?
I also found lots of advice out there:

Make a portfolio
Create a repo on GitHub
Make a technical blog
All of which is great advice: but not achievable (or intelligible!) for someone who is just starting out. I figured I would do this: I'm going to blog each step of my learning. I'm going to post my unfiltered questions. As I answer them, I'll put them in new posts. I'll also share what programs I've done, in the hopes of helping others along the way. I won't post anything in a form that I haven't learned how to do myself, meaning this site is going to look very 1996 for a while. If I upgrade it later, I'll be sure to post screen shots of where we started.
Thanks for joining me.

About Me
I'm a rabbi, an investment banker, and a change maker. I'm living through COVID-19 and I got tired of knitting, baking and playstation. I decided I wanted to learn how to wrangle data and build things. I got hooked.

What is codeRav?
Rav is the Hebrew term for Rabbi, and the capitalization is a nod to CamelCase, which I only learned was a formal thing when learning JavaScript. With my training, a lot of the projects I want to build are based on Jewish text and community, so it made sense to incorporate that part of me in the name of the blog.</p1>
